# Citi Bike Analysis

## Project Overview
The client has asked to summarize various bike riding data to determine if a bike-sharing program is a worthwhile business pursuit in Des Moines. This includes:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

The client also wants all of this information displayed in a visual story via Tableau.

## Methodology
- Tools/Programs/Languages used:
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - Pandas library
    - Tableau
		- [Citi Bike Story](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBike_16498186540580/Story2?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

- I used the Pandas library to read the Citi Bike CSV and display it as a DataFrame. Then I changed the data type of the ```tripduration``` column so that date and time would display. I exported the new DataFrame as a CSV and loaded the new CSV in Tableau in order to create the story/visuals.
